   
   In a binary tree, if in the path from root to the node A, 
   there is no node with greater value than Aâ€™s, this node A is visible. 
   We need to count the number of visible nodes in a binary tree. 
   
   For example, in the following tree:
   
         5
       /   \  
      3     10
     / \   /
    20 21 1
    
    There are four (4) visible nodes: 5, 20, 21, and 10.
